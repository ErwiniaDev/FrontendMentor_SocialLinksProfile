## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

- Reuse the Modern CSS Reset
- Use the custom properties for colors and fonts
- Be careful with div (I used article... I don't know if it's a good practice)

### Continued development

It's not pixel perfect. I need to correct it.
And I don't use the good units I think (rem instead of pixels).

### Useful resources
